    "* NLP aims to develop methods for solving problems in language, such as information extraction, automatic speech recognition, question answering, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "* Computational linguistics helps to understand the properties of human language. \n",
    "* It is a part of Computer Science, Human Language, and Artificial Intelligence. It is the technology that is used by machines to understand, analyze, manipulate, and interpret human languages. It helps developers to organize knowledge for performing tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), speech recognition, relationship extraction, and topic segmentation.\n",

    "## Reviewing some useful string operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the text is represented by strings, objects of the str class. Strings are immutable sequences of characters. Creating a string object is easy ‚Äì we enclose the text in quotation marks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`word = 'Hello World'`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the word variable contains the string Hello World. As we mentioned,\n",
    "strings are sequences of characters, so we can ask for the first item of the\n",

    "Always remember to use parentheses with print, since we are coding in\n",
    "Python 3.x. We can similarly access other indices, as long as the index\n",
    "doesn't go out of bounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "word [4]\n",
    "# output\n",
    "'o'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How about string length? We can use the len method, just like with list and\n",

    "\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "len(word)\n",
    "11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also iterate over the characters of a string with sequence methods:\n",
